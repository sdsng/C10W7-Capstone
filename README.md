# C10W7 Data Science Capstone 

This repository contains all files necessary to satisfy requirement for the Data Science Capstone final project.


### Milestone Report

This file contains the preliminary codes of building the word predictor. 


### Final Project Requirements

The goal of this exercise is to create a product to highlight the prediction algorithm that you have built and to provide an interface that can be accessed by others. For this project you must submit:
1) A Shiny app that takes as input a phrase (multiple words) in a text box input and outputs a prediction of the next word.
2) A slide deck consisting of no more than 5 slides created with R Studio Presenter pitching your algorithm and app as if you were presenting to your boss or an investor.

##### Shiny App link:
** Due to a technical issue, I was unable to publish the Shiny App. However, I have included the ui.R and server.R files in this Github repo for reference. **
